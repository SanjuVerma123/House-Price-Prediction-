🏡 House Price Prediction

This project predicts house prices based on various features like the number of rooms, location, area, and other housing attributes using Machine Learning models.

📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a regression model that can accurately predict the selling price of a house.
We used the Kaggle House Prices dataset and applied different regression algorithms to compare performance.
